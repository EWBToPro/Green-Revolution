Engineers Without Borders is an organization dedicated to educating students about international equity issues. They are running a workshop on the "Green Revolution", focusing on global food supply and production, as well as the role technology (new or old) plays in it.

## Description about the project
A mobile game where you play as a farmer trying to grow as much wheat and gain as much profit as you can. It has an educational aspect to it, and educates players on issues surrounding global food production and the role of technology in farming.
​
## Key Features
TBD throughout development of the project.
​
## Instructions
TBD throughout development of the project.
 
## Development requirements
Unity Engine, LTS version 2022.3.18f1, your local git branch should be configured to use Unity YAML merge.

Add this to your local git config file:
```
[merge]
    tool = unityyamlmerge
[mergetool "unityyamlmerge"]
    trustExitCode = false
    cmd = "PUT PATH TO UnityYAMLMerge.exe HERE" merge -p "$BASE" "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL" "$MERGED"
```

On Windows at least, the path to the tool is "C:/Program Files/Unity/Hub/Editor/2022.3.18f1/Editor/Data/Tools/UnityYAMLMerge.exe"
 
## Deployment and Github Workflow
​TBD throughout development of the project.

Access our Trello here: https://trello.com/b/YwVbyUKp/green-revolution  (you may need to request permission).

 ## Coding Standards and Guidelines
TBD throughout development of the project. Most likely we will use C# guidelines, since that's what Unity uses.
​
 ## Licenses 
TBD throughout development of the project.
