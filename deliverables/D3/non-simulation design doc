Reference:
-See EWBFiles/storyboard.pdf for reference

Decisions Summary:
-Popup windows are used to separate main sections
-Certain screens are omitted or merged into other ones to make the flow more natural

Potential Improvements:
-Need to find better art assets for pictures, logos and buttons
-Need to make detailed decisions on typography
-Animation and transitions will make the ui look more fluid. The one ui builder offers feels super clumsy to use. Might look for other solutions.
-Too many popup windows for now. All popup windows other than the ones between major sections need to be replaced.
-Maybe implement a scoreboard.

Details:
1.0 Loading Screen
	Omitted.
2.0  Welcome Screen
	Title reduced due to length limit.
2.1 Learn More Screen 
	Email will be displayed in link, the rest in logos.
	Reasoning: Buttons instead of links would be more visually pleasant, but email address is kept in the form of text due to the way people are expected to use it.
3.0 Introduction to the Green Revolution App Screen 
	Made into a popup window at the start of page 4.0
	Reasoning: Popup window with animation(animation not implemented yet) can give the feeling of separated sections.

	Notes: For the next deliverable, we can make the logos more like a set, and implement keyframe animation to make the ui more fluid.
