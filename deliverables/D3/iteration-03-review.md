# TEAM 13 - MR. CYBORG

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. What worked well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that worked well.


 * 2 - 4 important decisions, processes, actions, or anything else that worked well for you, ordered from most to least important.
 * Give a supporting argument about what makes you think that way.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Q2. What did not work well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that did not work well.

 * 2 - 4 important decisions, processes, actions, or anything else that did not work well for you, ordered from most to least important.
 * Give a supporting argument about what makes you think that way.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Q3(a). Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and/or how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important, with supporting argument explaining a change.

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps
Briefly explain how you integrated the previously developed individuals components as one product (i.e. How did you be combine the code from 3 sub-repos previously created) and if/how the assignment was helpful or not helpful.

 * Keep this very short (1-3 lines).


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
We were able to demo our progress in one of our biweekly meetings online (March 7). At this time the project was split in two branches (non-simulation screens and simulation screens), so we made two builds (Windows executables) and screenshared them both.

At this point, the non-simulation screens were starting to come together with basic styling and educational information written out, but accompanying images were still missing. The simulation screen was still incomplete, but it did feature updated menus and a reworked method of planting seeds and fertilizer.

Fidel, from EWB, said he liked what he saw and thought we were progressing well.


 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
 * What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
