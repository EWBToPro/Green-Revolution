## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 11, 2024
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. What worked well
- Organizing the work into non-simulation screens and simulation screens
    - Good separation of concerns, helps to avoid any conflicts, and is easier than us going back-and-forth between simulation code scenes non-simulation scenes
- Discord communication
    - Very convenient that we can just chat with each other online, we can ping each other when we have an important message
- UI Design Documentation
    - A Design Documentation is made to help us keep track of the design decisions.
    - See [non-simulation design doc](../D3/non-simulation%20design%20doc.md)

<!-- 
List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that worked well.


 * 2 - 4 important decisions, processes, actions, or anything else that worked well for you, ordered from most to least important.
 * Give a supporting argument about what makes you think that way.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s). -->

#### Q2. What did not work well
- We could have spent more time planning as a team what each screen looked like
    - Would have streamlined the process more and avoided any misunderstandings
- Too many people assigned to non-simulation screens
    - Non-simulation screens were relatively simpler than simulation screens, so we could have had one person move over

#### Q3(a). Planned changes

<!-- List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and/or how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important, with supporting argument explaining a change. -->
 - Discuss more about scene appearance
    - By the end of D3, the scenes will have been mostly completed. D4 will be polishing and implementing any missing features, we will discuss more as a team about what polishing we will do
    - See [non-simulation design doc](../D3/non-simulation%20design%20doc.md) for some potential improvements on UI
- Be more clear about how much time we should spend on each task
    - Knowing a time estimate can help us plan ahead, especially if one of us gets technical issues

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps
We split Deliverable 2 into the three simulation phases. It was straightforward to put it all together because each phase just needed to read some static data, so all we needed to do was make the advance buttons in each scene load the next scene. It was helpful practice dividing up a project, but it seems more appropriate for a web app; I think it would have been easier for all of us to work on each phase sequentially.

As for next steps after D3, we just need to polish up the GUI, put in pop-up notifications, and add a tutorial.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
We were able to demo our progress in one of our biweekly meetings online (March 7). At this time the project was split in two branches (non-simulation screens and simulation screens), so we made two builds (Windows executables) and screenshared them both.

At this point, the non-simulation screens were starting to come together with basic styling and educational information written out, but accompanying images were still missing. The simulation screen was still incomplete, but it did feature updated menus and a reworked method of planting seeds and fertilizer.

Fidel, from EWB, said he liked what he saw and thought we were progressing well. There were no requests to change or add features because our MVP was well-defined from the start (also he gave us storyboards to work with).

The entire project so far has been a good learning experience. We learned how to discuss user stories and collaborate with a partner to meet their MVP.


 <!-- * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
 * What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed* -->
